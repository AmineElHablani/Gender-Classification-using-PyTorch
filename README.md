# Gender Classification using PyTorch

This project aims to implement gender classification using PyTorch, focusing on image data. It includes various functionalities and techniques to train and evaluate models for accurate gender prediction.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Augmentation**: Efficiently load image datasets and apply data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
  
- **Model Architectures**: Implement multiple pretrained models and custom architectures using PyTorch to explore different approaches to gender classification.

- **Training and Evaluation**: Define functions for model training with automated hyperparameter tuning, learning rate reduction, and checkpointing based on validation metrics.

- **Progress Monitoring**: Display training progress, including epoch updates, training accuracy and loss per iteration, and validation results after each epoch.

- **Result Analysis**: Save training histories and final model weights for comparison across different hyperparameter settings to analyze training and validation performance.
